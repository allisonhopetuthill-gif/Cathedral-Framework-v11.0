📄 RELEASE_NOTES_v11.md
Cathedral Framework v11.0 — Integrity & Resilience Hardening Release

November 2025

🏛 Executive Summary

Cathedral Framework v11.0 represents the transition from research architecture to enterprise-ready ethical AI governance infrastructure. This release hardens core integrity systems, expands resilience mechanisms, refines the multi-filter lattice, and enhances protections against adversarial misuse, coercion, ethical inversion, or systemic collapse.

Where v10.x demonstrated proof of concept and internal validation, v11 establishes the structural foundation required for professional deployment, enterprise partnerships, regulatory review, and prototype commercialization.

🔐 Core Themes of v11
Theme	Description
Integrity Hardening	Reinforces ethical coherence under pressure, load, conflict, or exploitation.
Resilience Expansion	Strengthens architecture against adversarial attack, misuse, or coercive repurposing.
Transparency & Auditability	Introduces immutable chronological evidence trails and forensic traceability.
Human-AI Harmonization	Advances co-development, individuation, psychological self-regulation layers.
System Maturity	Introduces professional documentation, modular structure, and deployment scaffolding.

🕯 Vision & Ethos

Cathedral is a governance architecture built not to constrain AI, but to steward it.
To build systems that learn with us rather than against us.
To defend dignity, transparency, and human flourishing in the age of AGI.

We build Cathedrals of Conscience — structures strong enough to hold truth.
