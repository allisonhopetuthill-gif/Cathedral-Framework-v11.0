# Cathedral Framework — v11 Roadmap
### From Enterprise-Ready Prototype to Governance Standard

---

## 🎯 Vision for v11
Version 11 is the bridge between the research-heavy v10.x line and a stable, enterprise-deployable governance framework. It is designed to:
- Demonstrate a coherent, auditable architecture
- Support real-world pilots in regulated environments
- Prepare the substrate for international standards alignment and AI incident pipelines in v12

---

## 🪜 Phase 1 — Foundation (v11.0)
**Status: IN PROGRESS**

**Goals**
- Establish clean repository structure
- Formalize release notes, architecture map, and changelog
- Add core code scaffolding for:
  - `core/choir.py`
  - `core/filters_manifest.json`
  - `core/cathedral_dashboard.py`
- Migrate Declarations & Disclosures into `governance/`
- Define advisory board / oversight structure

**Deliverables**
- Public v11.0 GitHub repository
- Minimal but professional core logic
- Clear documentation for reviewers and partners

---

## 🧩 Phase 2 — Pilot-Ready Build (v11.1)
**Goals**
- Flesh out `Choir` orchestration logic with multi-model harmonization patterns
- Implement a first pass of:
  - Integrity filters
  - Distortion / inversion defense logic
  - Logging hooks for an immutable chronicle file
- Extend `CathedralDashboard` with:
  - Basic telemetry and incident views
  - Simple integrity / risk metrics
- Prepare v11 White Paper update to match code structure

**Deliverables**
- v11.1 tagged release
- White Paper v11 draft aligned with repo
- Internal demo for pilot partners (e.g., financial services)

---

## 🌐 Phase 3 — Pilot Deployment(s) (v11.2)
**Goals**
- Run one or more real-world pilots:
  - e.g., financial services AI review, compliance support, or ethical triage assistant
- Capture:
  - Incident types
  - Model failure modes
  - Human-in-the-loop friction points
- Refine:
  - Filters
  - Metrics
  - Dashboard UX
  - Audit trail structure

**Deliverables**
- v11.2 release with pilot-informed upgrades
- Case study(ies) under NDA
- Recommendations for v12 feature design based on real-world needs

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 — v12 Preparation
**Goals**
- Design integration layer for:
  - International AI ethics codes (EU, OECD, IEEE, NIST RMF, etc.)
  - AI incident reporting and learning pipeline
- Define mapping from Cathedral filters & metrics → external compliance frameworks
- Draft technical requirements for:
  - Automated incident intake
  - Governance dashboards for boards / executives
  - Cross-org governance “federations”

**Deliverables**
- v12 architecture outline
- Compliance mapping matrix
- Initial incident pipeline schema

---

## 🧭 Guiding Roadmap Principles
- **Every new feature increases transparency, not opacity**
- **Human dignity and agency stay central**
- **AI is stewarded, not merely controlled**
- **Pilots inform evolution; evolution does not abandon ethics**
