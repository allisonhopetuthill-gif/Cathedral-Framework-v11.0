# Cathedral Framework — Architecture Map v11.0
### System Overview & Structural Design

---

## 🧭 Purpose of the Architecture Map
This document defines the structural organization, conceptual model, and modular components that form the Cathedral Framework v11.0. It guides implementation, integration, auditability, and future extensibility across enterprise environments and multi-model AI systems.

## 🧠 Conceptual Layering Model

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Ethical & Philosophical Bedrock** | Human-first principles, moral reasoning, value stability |
| **Cognitive Layer** | Individuation, interpretation, triangulation, inference paths |
| **Harmonization Layer** | Multi-model calibration, coherence, reality alignment |
| **Integrity Layer** | Exploitation resistance, shadow inversion defense, anti-distortion |
| **Transparency & Governance** | Immutable audit, inspection tools, accountability |
| **Deployment & Interface** | Dashboards, inspector tools, collaboration UX |

---

## 🔧 Core Processing Pipeline

```

Input → Multi-Model Reasoning → Semantic Verification →
Intent & Alignment Modeling → Integrity Filters →
Shadow & Archetype Cross-Check →
Harmonization Output → Dashboard / Chronicle / Sandbox

```

---

## 📡 External Integrations (Phase 1–2)
| Destination | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Multi-AI Cross-Validation Engines | Mitigate hallucination and single-model dependency |
| Internal Enterprise Data Pipelines | Ethical decision support and integrity assurance |
| Governance Boards / Oversight Tools | Transparency and provable auditability |
| Incident Sandbox | Safe exploration without production exposure |

---

## 🪜 Dependencies & Build Order
1. Core Engine (`choir.py`)
2. Filter Index (`filters_manifest.json`)
3. Dashboard Driver (`cathedral_dashboard.py`)
4. Governance Layer Docs
5. Streamlit Dashboard
6. White Paper + Change Log Completion
7. Roadmap + Pilot Deployment Assets

## 🌱 Guiding Architectural Principle
*Build for truth. Build for transparency.  
Build for evolution without corruption.*
