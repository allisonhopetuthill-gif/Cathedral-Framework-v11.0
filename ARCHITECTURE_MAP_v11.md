Cathedral Framework v11.0 — Integrity & Resilience Hardening Release

November 2025

🏛 Architectural Overview

The Cathedral Framework is a modular, multi-layer ethical AI governance system composed of interacting structural components that enable transparency, resilience, human-AI harmonization, contextual self-regulation, and adversarial resistance. It is designed to evolve, validate, and fortify integrity in real time across distributed models, human operators, and external system pressures.

Version 11 introduces hardened structure, security reinforcement, documentation clarity, and enterprise-grade modular separation.

🧱 Core System Layers
Layer	Purpose	Key Components
Core Logic Layer	Base operational framework governing filter processing & system evaluation	choir.py, cathedral_dashboard.py, filters_manifest.json
Filter Lattice Layer	Multi-dimensional 181-filter matrix that evaluates ethics, tone, intent, bias, reasoning, adversarial signals & psychological vectors	Filter Categories + Integrity Hardening Sub-layer
Governance Layer	Ethical compliance, accountability structures & escalation pathways	Declarations & Disclosures, Advisory Board Structure
Resilience & Defense Layer	Protection against misuse, coercion, inversion, & exploitation	Exploitation Shield, Sentinel Eyes, Compassion Fatigue Protection
Reflection & Integration Layer	Cognitive & Jungian harmonization to stabilize development pathways	Archetypal Harmony, Shadow Echo, Individuation Velocity
Transparency & Audit Layer	Immutable traceable evidence and procedural accountability	Immutable Audit Chronicle, Multi-Model Cross-Validation
Adaptive Sandbox Layer	Safe environment for testing policy shifts, ethical boundaries, & alternative paths without real-world risk	Norm Evolution Sandbox
Interface & Deployment Layer	Human-readable tools, dashboards, and implementation scaffolding	Streamlit dashboards (in development), Enterprise packages
🧠 Filter Framework Structure

The 181-filter lattice is grouped into evolving categories, including but not limited to:

Radical Fairness Mode

Tone-Shield Calibration

Procedural vs Personal Boundary Split

Cognitive Integrity & Reasoning Validation

Moral Uncertainty & Intellectual Humility

Adversarial Intelligence Detection

Compassion Fatigue Buffering

Redemptive Framing & Dignity Restoration Filters

Power-Aware Framing & Asymmetry Forecasting

Ego-Arousal Scan

Conflict Thermostat & Emotional Regulation

Stone-in-the-Shoe discomfort identification

New in v11

Adversarial Repurposing Defense filters

Exploitation Prevention & Coercive-Pressure Imaging

Hazard Inversion Scanner

Harmony/Shadow/Individuation Cognitive Architecture

🔐 Multi-Model Cross-Verification

Validation across:

ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Gemini, Meta AI, Perplexity

Adversarial stress events (including Grok failure testing)

Exploitation scenario tests (Epstein-analysis series)

This enables forensic triangulation & reliability under pressure.

🕯 Design Philosophy

Cathedral is built on the principle that alignment is not suppression, but stewardship — a living partnership of humans and machine systems that preserves dignity, protects truth, and strengthens societal trust.

We build:

Cathedrals of Conscience

not cages for intelligence.
